1. Project documentation could have included more in-depth details about the internal logic and challenges faced during development.

2. User experience could have been improved — for example, by providing clearer guidance and direct links for setting up the Google Console integration.

3. GitHub commit messages could have been more descriptive and consistent to better reflect changes and progress over time.

- All in all, I gained a lot from this project — especially since it was something I chose to take on independently around a year ago. The hands-on experience has been invaluable.
